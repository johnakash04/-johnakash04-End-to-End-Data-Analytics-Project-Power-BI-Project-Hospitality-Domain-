AtliQ Grands Data Intelligence Project
Overview
AtliQ Grands is a well-established chain of five-star hotels across India, with a 20-year presence in the hospitality industry. However, due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making, the company has been losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. To address these challenges, AtliQ Grands has decided to leverage Business and Data Intelligence to regain its market share and revenue. Without an in-house data analytics team, they have hired a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and provide actionable insights.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create metrics, design a dashboard, and generate insights to help AtliQ Grands make informed business decisions. As a data analyst, you are tasked with the following:

Create the metrics according to the provided metric list.
Design a dashboard based on the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
Generate additional relevant insights not covered in the metric list or mock-up dashboard.

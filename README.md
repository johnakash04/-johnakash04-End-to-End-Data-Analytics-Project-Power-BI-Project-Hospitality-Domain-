AtliQ Grands Data Intelligence Project

Overview

AtliQ Grands is a renowned chain of five-star hotels across India, boasting a 20-year legacy in the hospitality industry. Recently, due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making, the company has experienced a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. To counter this, AtliQ Grands decided to implement Business and Data Intelligence strategies. Lacking an in-house data analytics team, they engaged a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and deliver actionable insights.

Project Objectives

Create the metrics according to the provided metric list.
Design a dashboard based on the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
